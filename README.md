Welcome,

This github page is for the game PuzzlePlatformer (name will change). Here you can see the code of the game and how it works. You can download the game by the releases tab. In the future there will be multiple there. By the release tab you can also see what is new or changed.

This project is started original because I wanted to make a game as project for school. 

I hope you like the project and have fun playing it!
